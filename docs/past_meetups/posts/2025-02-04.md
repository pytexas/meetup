#### Celery and its challenges in production - Dishant Sethi

Asynchronous task queues like Celery have become essential in handling time-consuming or background jobs and optimising performance in production.

Running Celery at scale comes with unique challenges. In this talk, will explore topics such as:

- maintaining worker reliability
- optimising tasks
- handling errors
- handling retries effectively
- task prioritisation
- monitoring
- autoscaling based on number of tasks under heavy workload."
