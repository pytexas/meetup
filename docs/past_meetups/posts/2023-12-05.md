Have you ever opened a file using the with keyword in Python? That little keyword is one of the many fascinating parts of the Python programming language, the Context Manager. The Python Context Manager is a tool that allows the programmer to reliably create and tear down temporary contexts within a program. This allows programmers to reduce duplicate code, improving the maintainability and reliability of the code. This talk will cover all things Context Manager, from what they are, how to build them, when to use them, and more.

* [Introduction to `pytest` - Test Automation University Course (free)](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/pytest-tutorial/)

What, you mean to tell me that you don't test your code?! Let's fix that right quick! In this session, let's learn how to start testing our code with pytest, Python's most popular test framework. We'll cover how to add pytest to a project, leverage mechanics like parameters and fixtures, and write tests at different levels. Bring your laptops, too, because this whole session will be live-coded!
