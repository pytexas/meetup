#### Boosting Python’s Performance With Multiprocessing to Bypass the GIL - Pavan Reddy

This talk explores Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), a limitation that restricts true parallel execution in multi-threaded programs. We examine how multiprocessing enables parallelism by bypassing the GIL, resulting in significant performance gains for CPU-bound tasks. Attendees will learn practical techniques to use multiprocessing effectively for scalable, high-performance Python applications.

*Pavan earned his M.S. in Computer Science from George Washington University, where he also served as a teaching assistant, delivering lectures on Computer Vision concepts in the context of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Currently, he works as a software engineer specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), with a focus on Adversarial Attacks and Explainable AI. Driven by a deep passion for ML and its transformative potential, Pavan became an educator to share his knowledge and help others understand ML in intuitive ways. Through his popular Instagram page, he has amassed a dedicated following of over 90,000 enthusiasts, making complex ML concepts accessible and empowering individuals to engage with technology that can contribute to a better, more
impactful world.*
