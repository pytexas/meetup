#### _Talk_: Python ❤️ Rust -Moshe Zadka

Introduction to Rust and how to use PyO3 to integrate Python with Rust.

_Moshe has been involved in the Linux community since 1998, helping in Linux "installation parties". They have been programming Python since 1999, and has contributed to the core Python interpreter. Moshe has been a DevOps/SRE since before those terms existed, caring deeply about software reliability, build reproducibility and other such things. They have worked in companies as small as three people and as big as tens of thousands -- usually some place around where software meets infrastructure._
