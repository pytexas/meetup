#### Diagrams and You - Josh Schneider

Before and After you code, you have to be able to communicate your ideas, both to yourself and to others. With humans being the visual creatures that we are, one of the most effective ways to communicate complex ideas is with a diagram. I mean, cave drawings worked for early man, why can't they work for engineers, right?

Come along as Josh talks about several types of diagrams, their properties, their faults, and what they're good for!
