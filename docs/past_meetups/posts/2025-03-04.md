#### Accelerate your pandas application with FireDucks; A multi-threaded DataFrame library with JIT Compiler - Sourav Saha

In this talk, I will introduce [FireDucks](https://fireducks-dev.github.io), that comes with a multithreaded kernel backend written in C++, a JIT compiler to auto-detect and optimize the existing performance issues involved in a user program, and a pure python frontend highly compatible with pandas allowing a native pandas application to be executed as it is without any manual changes. With the promise of highly compatible pandas APIs and the revved-up performance, FireDucks can serve the demands of this digital age and transform the arduous task of data wrangling into a more efficient and less taxing endeavor. It can be simply installed on any Linux system using pip.

*Sourav has 11 years of professional experience at NEC Corporation, Japan in the diverse fields of High-Performance Computing, Distributed Programming, and Data Science. He holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and is currently affiliated with the Digital Technology Development Laboratories at NEC as a Senior Research Engineer. Blending the mixture of different niche technologies related to compiler framework, high performance computing, and multi-threaded programming, his team is developing a high-performance compiler accelerated DataFrame library, named FireDucks. He is mostly passionate about program optimization, public speaking and has been speaking in several technical conferences, meetups etc.*
