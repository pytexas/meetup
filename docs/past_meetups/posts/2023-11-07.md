### _Talk:_ PEP Talk - Mariatta

If you use Python, chances are you've heard of PEP 8, the Python style guide.

But do you know what PEPs really are? PEPs are more than just a style guide. A PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It's a proposal documentation for when you want to change the Python programming language in a big way, for example when you want to change the syntax of Python. Think of the addition of f-strings, the walrus operator, or the ExceptionGroup, those changes all started with a PEP.

Let's have a PEP talk, where you can learn about the PEP process, what needs a PEP and what doesn't, and how you as community members can take part.

### _Talk:_  Writing Code for Other People to Use - Josh Schneider

Josh has opinions! In this session, those opinions are focused on turning out code, any code, for anyone to use. We'll talk about who we mean by "other people", what we mean by "use", a recap of "Josh's 3 (make that 4) UX Design Rules", and a veritable host of suggestions and hot takes. Let's discuss, commiserate, dissent, and disagree!
