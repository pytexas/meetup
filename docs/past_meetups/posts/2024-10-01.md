#### Open-source Data Loss Prevention tool: n0s1

> Are you monitoring your code base for leaked secrets? What about your project management and ticketing systems?
> 
> While most of us use secret scanners for source code, the SDLC begins before coding. Leaks may already be present in project management platforms like Jira, Confluence, and Asana.
> 
> `n0s1` (github.com/spark1security) is an open-source secret scanner designed for Data Loss Prevention during the early SDLC stages. It integrates with existing CI security scanners and supports GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Docker.

*Marcelo Sacchetin has been helping software developers over a decade to write secure code across multiple start-ups and Fortune 500 companies. He mainly focuses on building automation for SDL and empowering developers to master cybersecurity.*

*When he is not preventing secret leaks with n0s1 (pronunciation nosy), he can also be found having fun with car hacking, anti-virus evasion or building Python coding bots with his kids.*

*He founded spark1.us with the mission of helping companies to build secure software by leveraging open-source and automation.*
