#### Python and .NET - A Match Almost Made in Heaven

> I created a Python API for a .NET system using Python.NET. This API had a Pythonic layer which transformed Python class methods to a .NET API using a number of functional programming techniques. The goal of the API was to allow our customers to leverage existing Python resources to access a robust .NET API in order to solve their specific problems in a cost-effective way. Along the way, we were able to leverage the Python API to perform integration testing of our entire product.
