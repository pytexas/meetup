#### Boosting Python’s Performance With Multiprocessing to Bypass the GIL - Pavan Reddy

The rapid adoption of cloud-native technologies has fundamentally reshaped software engineering, enabling faster innovation, increased scalability, and improved reliability. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into modern cloud-native software stacks offers transformative potential, streamlining operations, enhancing decision-making, and automating complex tasks. This presentation explores the intersection of AI and cloud-native development, highlighting best practices for integrating intelligent solutions into contemporary software architectures. Featuring a practical demonstration of "CloudyBot," an AI-powered DevOps assistant chatbot, attendees will witness firsthand how large language models (LLMs) can effectively address real-world DevOps challenges, such as troubleshooting, deployment strategies, and operational inquiries. Participants will gain insights into leveraging AI-driven tools, such as OpenAI and Hugging Face transformers, to enhance their workflows, improve operational efficiency, and maintain robust cloud infrastructures.
