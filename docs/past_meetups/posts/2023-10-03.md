### Summary
Charlie gave a knowledge packed introduction to Ruff. He covered details such as
lexing, concurrency, and a lot of material around compiler design that he
uses to make Ruff fast.

The more detail and deeper into the code Charlie went the more excited the 
audience got. This was a highly technical talk and everyone was very happy
for it.
