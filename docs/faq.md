???+ question "Why are y'all virtual?"

    This meetup was started to give Python Developers with the _humongous_ state of Texas a place where they can meet, network, and learn without having to go out of their way to attend and in person meetup. We had heard from many people that they were unable to attend their local meetup for various reasons, and wanted to give them the same opportunities.
