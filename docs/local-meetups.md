# Join Your Local Meetup

Want to meetup with people in your home city? Texas has various Python meetups
throughout the state. Join yours today!

??? info "Inactive Meetups"

    A large number of meetups have yet to come back post-pandemic, or the meetup
    is no longer active. If you're interested in starting that particular meetup
    back up, let us know and we'll try to connect you with those organizers
    and get it going again. 

??? question "How do you determine if a Meetup is inactive?"

    Active/Inactive designation is set if a meetup hasn't scheduled an
    event in over a year. If you see anything on this list that is inaccruate
    please let us know.
