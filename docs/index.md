### April Meetup - April 1, 2025

#### Boosting Python’s Performance With Multiprocessing to Bypass the GIL - Pavan Reddy

This talk explores Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), a limitation that restricts true parallel execution in multi-threaded programs. We examine how multiprocessing enables parallelism by bypassing the GIL, resulting in significant performance gains for CPU-bound tasks. Attendees will learn practical techniques to use multiprocessing effectively for scalable, high-performance Python applications.
