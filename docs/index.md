#### Scaling Your Tests to Infinity and Beyond - Pandy Knight

Testing is a risk-mitigating activity that takes time. 
Ideally, we want to cover as many behaviors as possible in the shortest amount of time for fast feedback. 
The only way to speed up is to scale up. But how?

This talk outlines a playbook for the five most impactful ways to scale up tests. 
From improving infrastructure to arranging tests more efficiently down to refining the performance of particular steps, you will learn tried-and-true techniques for running more tests in less time. 
With this playbook, you could scale up to hundreds of tests running concurrently without crashing.

Join this session to supercharge your testing efforts and scale your test execution to infinity and beyond!
