#### X Architectures and Counting - Piper Thunstrom

Lots of folks wait to start their "dream" project, hoping to develop the right skill set to execute it perfectly. Through the lens of the architecture if ppb, Piper will share the lessons she learned over its decade of development and why you should just get started and level up as you go.
