#### Events are the Wrong Abstraction - Mason Egger

Modern software applications are distributed systems. 
Applications need to connect and communicate with services, data repositories, users, etc., all over a network. 
Event-Driven Architecture is a common pattern for facilitating this connectivity, using Events as the communication abstraction. 
However, this pattern introduces complexities as well, such as fragmented logic, increased latency, decreased observability, and more. 
But what if there were a way to get the benefits of Event-Driven Architecture without the complexities? Enter Durable Execution. 
In this talk, we'll discuss the pitfalls of Event-Driven Architecture, how Durable Execution solves these issues, and why Durable Execution, not Events, is the correct abstraction for building software.
