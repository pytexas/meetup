**LLM-powered Merge Conflict Resolution** - Advitya Gemawat

Merge Conflicts in software programming occur in 20% of all merges in open-source projects, incurring a median resolution time of ~6 minutes for a single conflict at best, or multiple days at worst. This talk will touch upon LLM Evaluations, Azure OpenAI Fine-Tuning, AI-generated resolution explanations, and usage of multiple Python SDKs to craft a scalable LLM-powered Merge Conflict Resolver. Our results indicate up to 125% performance improvement over vanilla LLM resolution accuracy.
