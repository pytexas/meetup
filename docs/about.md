# About
The PyTexas Meetup was started in the Summer of 2023 by Brad Brown, Josh Cannon, Josh Schneider
Mason Egger, and Matt Criswell. The goal of this meetup was to create a space
for Texas Pythonistas to be able to meet, network, and learn from the comfort
of their own home. This idea for this meetup came about when we heard that there
were people who lived in a major Texas metropolitan area that were unable to attend
their local cities meetup because it would take hours of travel time to get there.

For those of you unaware of the sheer size of Texas, it can take anywhere of up
to 3-5 hours to cross from one side of a major Texas city to the other.

However, the PyTexas meetup is welcome to everyone! Not just Texans!

We hope to see **y'all** there!

## Current Organizers

### Brad Brown

Brad is currently a Fullstack Developer at Habitat Energy,
specializing in Python and Infrastructure work across his career.
He describes himself as a Python Engineer born from the ashes
of a restaurant operator.
When not working, you'll most often find him either
curled up with a good book
or trying to get his teenagers to go do something fun.

### Josh Cannon

Josh is a Build Engineer by day, and maintainer of the Pantsbuild Open Source Build System also by day. 
And sometimes participates in other open source projects, Python community discussions, and conference speaking... also by day
(what? there's a lot of hours in the daytime).

At night you'll catch him speding time with his wife and kids, obsessively reading Brandon Sanderson, playing Frosthaven, and laser cutting/engraving.

### Matt Criswell

Matt works at a startup as a DevOps Engineer. He has previously worked at Mirantis and Rackspace holding various titles such as SRE, Ops Engineer, and Linux Admin.  With a coding style that can only be described as "effortless" he puts newbies at ease by proving anyone can learn Python.

### Josh Schneider

Test Automation Architect, Python nerd, Improv comedy nerd, father, drinker of coffee, and quoter of movies. I love sharing ideas with people, and I am action packed with opinions like an 80's action movie.
