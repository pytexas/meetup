# About Us

The goal of this meetup is to create a space for Texas Pythonistas to be able to meet, network, and learn from the comfort of their own home. 
For those of you unaware of the sheer size of Texas, it can take anywhere of up to 3-5 hours to cross from one side of a major Texas city to the other.

However, the PyTexas meetup is welcome to everyone! Not just Texans!

We hope to see **y'all** there!

## Current Organizers

### Brad Brown

Brad is currently a Fullstack Developer at Habitat Energy,
specializing in Python and Infrastructure work across his career.
He describes himself as a Python Engineer born from the ashes
of a restaurant operator.
When not working, you'll most often find him either
curled up with a good book
or trying to get his teenagers to go do something fun.

### Josh Cannon

Josh is a Build Engineer by day, and maintainer of the Pantsbuild Open Source Build System also by day. 
And sometimes participates in other open source projects, Python community discussions, and conference speaking... also by day
(what? there's a lot of hours in the daytime).

At night you'll catch him speding time with his wife and kids, obsessively reading Brandon Sanderson, playing Frosthaven, and laser cutting/engraving.

As community chair, he is dedicated to fostering community growth and making PyTexas a valuable resource for developers at every stage of their journey.

## History 

The PyTexas Meetup was started in the Summer of 2023 by Brad Brown, Josh Cannon, Josh Schneider Mason Egger, and Matt Criswell. 
This idea for this meetup came about when we heard that there were people who lived in a major Texas metropolitan area that were unable to attend their local cities meetup because it would take hours of travel time to get there.

## Past Organizers

### Matt Criswell

Matt works at a startup as a DevOps Engineer. He has previously worked at Mirantis and Rackspace holding various titles such as SRE, Ops Engineer, and Linux Admin.  With a coding style that can only be described as "effortless" he puts newbies at ease by proving anyone can learn Python.
