# About
The PyTexas Meetup was started in the Summer of 2023 by Brad Brown, Josh Cannon,
Mason Egger, and Matt Criswell. The goal of this meetup was to create a space
for Texas Pythonistas to be able to meet, network, and learn from the comfort
of their own home. This idea for this meetup came about when we heard that there
were people who lived in a major Texas metropolitan area that were unable to attend
their local cities meetup because it would take hours of travel time to get there.

For those of you unaware of the sheer size of Texas, it can take anywhere of up
to 3-5 hours to cross from one side of a major Texas city to the other. 

However, the PyTexas meetup is welcome to everyone! Not just Texans! 

We hope to see **y'all** there!
